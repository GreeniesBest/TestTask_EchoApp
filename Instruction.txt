                   Notes
-------------------------------------------

1) I got EchoServer example from the Poco library (\Net\samples\EchoServer) and reworked it according to the my task need. The rework is heavy! The resulting EchoApp works in single thread: uses non blocking sockets and uses asynchronous handling of the socket(s) event's. EchoApp works fine with multiple connections.

2) Note to reviewer: please treat the implementation here not as "the best i can do thing", nor "the thing i would do if this task would be a real job task", nor the "professional example". This implementation is for just demonstrating the skills (familiarizing with Poco library and to show some work with sockets) and nothing more!

3) Note 2 to reviewer: in the implementation here, I simplified things a bit: while application writes over the socket, it does not read from the socket anything. This is to simplify the implementation - to make the code a bit more easy to read and understand.

4) I compiled and tested the EchoApp on the Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.

                Instruction
-------------------------------------------

In order to compile and run the EchoApp:
- the Poco library must be installed: sudo apt-get install libpoco-dev
- gcc compiler and make must be installed: sudo apt install build-essential

For telnet application to connect without issues, install telnet service: sudo apth-get install telnetd.
To check that telnet service is running: sudo systemctl status inetd


To compile and run the EchoApp perform following steps in order as below:

1) get snapshot of the EchoApp from Github repository, extract it to some directory, open console and enter "cd <directory where EchoApp extracted>"  

2) compile EchoApp:
make
 
3) run EchoApp:
./EchoApp

4) open another terminal and run:
telnet <IP address of the host where EchoApp is running> 28888

Use 127.0.0.1 for IP address if EchoApp is locally running (do not omit the IP address argument for the telnet!):
telnet 127.0.0.1 28888

5) Type any string in the telnet app and press <enter>. Observe the reversed string.

Note1: EchoApp may handle the multiple connections simultaneously! I.e open several terminal windows and in each terminal launch the telnet to connect to the same instance of the EchoApp. It should be working fine.
